1. Preprocessing ---> cell filtering and peak calling to generate peak by cell matrix
2. DimReduction ---> perform dimension reduction using different method
3. DownstreamAnalysis ---> data integration, clustering, label transfer, evaluation, sub-clustering of fibroblasts, trajectory analysis, peak-to-gene prediction
