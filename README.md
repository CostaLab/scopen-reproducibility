For reproducibility, we provide all codes and scripts to reproduce the analysis in our scopen manuscript. 
The scripts are organized for each dataset. 

### Availablity of data
For each dataset, we here also provide the processed data, including count matrix, cell labels, 
imputed matrix from all methods, clustering results using 
imputed matrices, dimension reduction results, clustering using the dimension reduced matrices, 
downstream analysis.
